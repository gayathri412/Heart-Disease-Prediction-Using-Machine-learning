# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early diagnosis crucial. This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. Patient medical data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and ECG results are used for prediction. Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, are implemented and compared. Random Forest uses multiple decision trees and majority voting to provide stable predictions, while XGBoost improves accuracy by sequentially correcting errors using gradient boosting. The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that machine learning models can effectively assist doctors in early detection of heart disease and support clinical decision-making.
Project Methodology

Data Collection
Heart disease dataset is collected from reliable medical sources containing patient health attributes.

Data Preprocessing
Missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and data is normalized to improve model performance.

Feature Selection
Important features related to heart disease are selected to reduce complexity and increase accuracy.

Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Random Forest and XGBoost models are trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Comparison and Analysis
Performance of Random Forest and XGBoost is compared to identify the best model.

Prediction and Result
The best-performing model is used to predict heart disease and display final results.

Result

Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieved high prediction accuracy.

XGBoost showed better performance due to boosting and regularization.

Random Forest provided stable and reliable results with less tuning.

Evaluation metrics confirmed effective classification of heart disease cases.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict heart disease using patient medical data. Random Forest offers robustness and simplicity, while XGBoost provides higher accuracy and efficiency. The system supports early diagnosis and assists healthcare professionals in decision-making. Future improvements can include larger datasets, deep learning models, and real-time clinical integration.
