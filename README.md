# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning
Heart Disease Prediction uses machine learning to analyze patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. Random Forest uses multiple decision trees and majority voting for accurate results. XGBoost improves predictions by correcting errors sequentially, providing higher accuracy and efficiency.
